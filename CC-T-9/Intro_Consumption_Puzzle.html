# Introduction

---

## Microfoundation of Macroeconomics

--

1. Consumption decision - by individual person or household - a micro matter with macro consequences 

--

2. Importance of consumption in both short-run and long-run 

--

- short-run: Keynesian analysis - short-run fluctuations

--

- long-run: Solow Growth Model - role of savings in deciding the steady state

--

3. The Consumption

--

a. we shall revise Keynesian consumption function

--

b. discuss supportive evidences and anomalies

--

c. state the consumption puzzle

# Keynes's Conjecture

---

## Features of Keynesian Consumption Function

--

1. 0 &lt; MPC &lt; 1

--

2. As income rises, APC (i.e. C/Y) falls and vice-versa

--

3. (current) Income is the primary determinant of (current) consumption; interest is not that important (stark contrast with the classical thought). Specially in the short run interest rate was not significant determinant of income. 

--

The consumption function `\(C = a + bY_{d}\)`

Where,

--

`\(C\)` = consumption expenditure

--

`\(a\)` = autonomous consumption

--

`\(b\)` = MPC

--

`\(Y_{d}\)` = disposable income

# Reliability of Keynesian Theory



---
## Early Empirical Evidences

--

- Survey results showed - households with higher income spend more on consumption (proving MPC&gt;0) but they also save more than households with lower income (implying MPC&lt;1)

--

- Households with higher income were found to save larger share of their income (i.e. APS rises as income rises = APC falls as income increases) 

--

- Studies concerning inter-war period - during periods of lower income (e.g. Great Depression) - people consumed lesser and saved lesser implying 0 &lt; MPC &lt;1 and C/Y ratio was relatively higher during the periods of recession and depression implying APC falls as Y rises and APC rises as Y falls. Further, no other variable appeared as relevant as income in explaining consumption behaviour as the correlation between consumption and income was found to be very high 



---

# Anomalies 

--

- The first anomaly - economists prediction about stagnation after WW-II. As income would rise, C/Y would fall and S/Y would rise. But there may not be enough investment to absorb so much extra savings. That would mean, low (relative) consumption would lead to inadequate demand for goods and services. It might lead to a recession once war is over and government spending also slows down subsequently. --- fear of SECULAR STAGNATION (it was totally based on the principle of Keynesian consumption function). But that did not happen even though income went up in the post-WW-II era. 

--

- The second anomaly: Simon Kuznet constructed new aggregate data on consumption and income (back to 1869), compiling this data in 1940s. Got Nobel prize later for the same. From decade to decade the S/Y was very much stable even if there was large increase in income from decade to decade.

# Consumption Puzzle

---
## What is so puzzling? 

--

- Combining the failure of secular stagnation hypothesis and Kuznet's findings it seemed that in the long run APC is stable as income rises (opposite to what Keynes suggested). 

--

- But Keynes's argument seems to be holding true for the short time-series data and household survey data.

--

This puzzle needed to be resolved. 

So various  economists tried to provide some answer to this problem. They tried to extend a theory which can explain both of these contradictory patterns of reality. In this regard we shall learn the following three: 

--

- Life Cycle Hypothesis proposed by Ando and Modigliani

--

- Permanent Income Hypothesis proposed by Milton Friedman

--

- Relative Income Hypothesis proposed by Duesenberry
